# Base of Classic Skype
 The repository contains a lot of content related to older versions of Skype.
 
 The repository was created for historical purposes (as the messenger of the same name will end in May 2025)
 
 Initially plan to just upload here the sources of the now dead site, but later decided to upload everything I had on the old versions

 Do whatever you want with this repository and its contents 

# PART 2 AVAILABLE - https://archive.org/details/base-of-classic-skype_20250228_2145


## Classic Skype Website
The Website folder contains both the pre-rendered HTML with the site and the full WBS project of the site with all the assets (although there's little point in unloading them now)

### WBS
To open WBS project you need WYSIWYG Web Builder 18 (for projects inside skybackup folder) or WYSIWYG Web Builder 19 (for projects inside SKYLIB folder).

The projects in these folders are

- skybackup
    * skybackup_04 - website project dated November 20, 2023 (aka Revision 2.3 (Dashie))
    * skybackup_19 - website project dated February 3, 2024 (aka Revision 3.0 (rainbowvika))
    * skylib31 - website project dated March 23, 2024 (beta version 3.2 (magixa))

- skylib
    * skylib31 - website draft dated August 30, 2024 (aka Revision 3.2 (magixa))

### Pre-rendered HTML
You can open it locally or on a regular HTTP server (since the code doesn't contain PHP due to Github restrictions)

- Versions of the sites in the folder
    * classicskype-Jul2023 - Site version dated August 2, 2023 (revision 2.1), also in the same folder is site version dated September 2022 (revision 1.0).
